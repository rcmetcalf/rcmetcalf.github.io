		<h3>Module 3: Information Structures</h3>
		<p>
			<div class="jumbotron-1">
				1. What have you acquired from the previous module? How are things you have learned different from what you knew before the module?</div><br>
			<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This module about information structures taught me that computers use specific languages to build webpages, write documents, and follow instructions. Everything we see on a webpage is text processed and structured by the computer. <br>
			<br>Even this web page is all text! See:

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extenisble markup language, or XML, is the framework used to create all other types of coding languages, like hyper text markup language (HTML) and cascading style sheets (CSS). In the photo above, I used HTML to create a structure for this webpage, but I also used XML. The doctype declaration at the top of the image is XML, as well as the title and links. The doctype declaration tells the computer that this file should be read and rendered as an HTML file. The title defines the webpage's name, and the links are associated with the CSS document and imported fonts. This text is not seen on the page, but the computer uses this metadata to build the page correctly.<br><br>

			Notice the doctype comment at the top.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XML, HTML, and CSS all have specific standards of use on the web. As Dr. Berquist said, it is helpful to know the web standards "so that we can know when and why we might have to deviate from them." Web standards apply to both the structural layer (HTML and XML) and the presentational layer (CSS). For example, using HTML code for presentational purposes such as background color or font color, although it might show up on the webpage, would not be an appropriate use of HTML. To change presentational features, you should use CSS.<br><br>
			
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides coding languages, I also learned about relational databases. A single-table database is known as a flat database. It's simple to create and use, but it cannot work for large scale databases because flat databases can produce a lot of redundancy of information. For example, the table below is an example of a flat database:<br>
			<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13002608/10264318/c81cf22a-69d5-11e5-9878-b6b2de7edbd2.png"><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this table is very small, it has many redundancies. Penguin publishing group is repeated 4 different times under entity "Publisher," and the Penguin email is repeated another 4 times, too. John Steinbeck is listed three times for three separate books. JK Rowling is also listed twice. The table is not sorted alphabetically, and there is no individual specific identifier, like a primary key, to distinguish between authors or titles. In all, this table could be better represented using a relational database.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relational database is created by breaking apart the flat database into multiple tables, or entities, with specific and relavent attributes. Using the example above, I would create entities like<br><br>
			
				* Book -- attributes could be "Title" and "ISBN"<br>
				* Publisher -- attributes could be "Name," "City," and "Email"<br>
				* Author -- attributes could be "Name," "Age," and "Hometown"<br>
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll also need to create a primary key as a unique identifier for each book. I can use the ISBN number. These new categories will be related to each other in the database. Now, when someone wants to find out what books Penguin has published, they can create a query and search the database. In INLS 161, we did some basic database management practice, and we created a relational databse and queries from a large flat database. Here are some of the database files we worked with:<br><br>
				* <a href="http://rcmetcalf.github.io/content/inls-161-book-database.odb">Book Database</a><br>
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the above file, there are 2 tables or entities, Books and Publishers. After we created our relational database and added our publisher ID (PubID) primary key, we were able to create relationships between the tables. I created queries like "Books published in the U.S. before 1950" to find very specific information.<br>
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we began this module, I knew the basics of HTML and CSS. I knew how to manipulate website templates like <a href="http://carte-noire.jacobtomlinson.co.uk/">this one</a> to create my own <a href="http://rcmetcalf.github.io">webpage</a>. I had also done a little bit of work with <a href="http://rcmetcalf.github.io/content/inls-161-book-database.odb">database management</a>. In all, I know more about the application of the languages and databases than the theory behind them.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this module, I learned more about the standards and origin of these coding languages, found new coding tools, and learned about the types of relations in a database. I learned that HTML originated from SGML, or Standard Generalized Markup Language, and XML is the language used to describe the metadata of a document. Before this module, I did most of my coding at Codeanywhere.com, Github, or a plain text editor, but now I know about Text Wrangler! I like that it highlights tags for easier reading. Although I had worked with databases before, I did not now about the different types of relationships between entities. Here's what I learned:<br><br>
			* A one-to-one relationship is a connection where a first table is only associated to a second table at one point, and that second table is only associated to the first table at one point. Ex: A wife only has one husband, and a husband only has one wife. (This relationships is not common in databases)<br>
				
			* A one-to-many relationship is a connection where a first table is asscoiated to many points in a second table, but the second table is only associated to one point in the first table. Ex: A man has many sons, but the son only has one father. (This relationship is the most common)
				<br>
			* A many-to-many relationship is a connection where a first table is associated to many points in a second table, and the second table is associated to many points in the first table. Ex: A family can have many pets, and a pet can have many owners (members of the family). (This relationship is less common than one-to-many, but it can be essential in the database)<br>
			</p><br>

				2. How do you interact with the structures we have discussed? Talk about instances in your academic and non-academic life.</div><br>
			<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I use information structures like HTML and CSS very often. This webpage is part of a website that I edited using those languages. I started working on this specific webpage in the summer to practice building a page from scratch. Once I started my INLS 201 Module 3 Report, I edited the webpage content for the assignment. Even if I'm not writing the code myself, everytime I get on the Internet I am interacting with the information structures. Every website utilizes HTML, XML, and CSS in its construction and use.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not use databases unless in a class setting, but I would like to learn more about them. I want to work for museums or cultural resource management organizations when I graduate, and many job descriptions in these fields require experience in DBMS.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In school, I use these structures to complete and track class assignments. All of my courses use a class webpage, whether it's on Sakai or a separate site. Both sites are built by information structures, and in the case of INLS 201, I use the very same structures when I complete class assignments (ex: I wrote this webpage in all HTML and CSS -- information structures). I want to organize my class assignments in a Github repository, too, which will require some use of HTML.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I use web all the time in my personal life. My phone, laptop, or any electronic device I use has code associated with it. I don't see the code, but I do see the finished product. The computer does all the "behind the scenes" work to render the pages correctly. Usually, I only see code on my webpages when there is an error.<br>
			</p><br>
			<div class="jumbotron-2">
				3. Is understanding of the structures important for citizens of our information environment, or can an individual succeed without understanding how things work?<br> 
				Share your discoveries.</div><br>
			<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I learned about information structures, I rarely thought about the time and resources put into web and other electronic management. I could navigate the web just fine, even though I didn't know about HTML or CSS. But now that I know about these structures, I think that it is very important for all people to know at least the basics of information structures.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more aspects of daily life are being incorporated into the web. Schools place course information online, people use Google religiously, and a personal webpage can be used as a resume. If people learn how to code for themselves, they will be able to stay up-to-date with changes in information technology, or even contribute to it themselves. I know that I personally view the Internet and other information systems differently now that I know how they are organized and built. For example, when I receive "404 errors" now, I understand that the webpage could be missing because of a incorrectly named link path. Before I knew about information structures, I thought that error was caused by dropped wifi or a faulty computer.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding information structures may not be necessary to use the web or make a basic table, but it definitely benefits people to know why and how these concpets work. You don't <em>have</em> to know how your car's engine works to drive it, but it's very useful to understand how it works in case your car breaks down. Same thing goes for information structures. Knowing how codes and databases work can be very helpful when you have to troubleshoot technology problems.<br>
