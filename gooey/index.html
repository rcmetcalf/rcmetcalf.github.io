		<h3>Module 3: Information Structures</h3>

				1. What have you acquired from the previous module? How are things you have learned different from what you knew before the module?</div><br>
			<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This module about information structures taught me that computers use specific languages to build webpages, write documents, and follow instructions. Everything we see on a webpage is text processed and structured by the computer. <br>
			<br>Even this web page is all text! See:

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extenisble markup language, or XML, is the framework used to create all other types of coding languages, like hyper text markup language (HTML) and cascading style sheets (CSS). In the photo above, I used HTML to create a structure for this webpage, but I also used XML. The doctype declaration at the top of the image is XML, as well as the title and links. The <!DOCTYPE> declaration tells the computer that this file should be read and rendered as an HTML file. The title defines the webpage's name, and the links are associated with the CSS document and imported fonts. This text is not seen on the page, but the computer uses this metadata to build the page correctly.<br>

			Notice the <!DOCTYPE> comment at the top.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XML, HTML, and CSS all have specific standards of use on the web. As Dr. Berquist said, it is helpful to know the web standards "so that we can know when and why we might have to deviate from them." Web standards apply to both the structural layer (HTML and XML) and the presentational layer (CSS).

				2. How do you interact with the structures we have discussed? Talk about instances in your academic and non-academic life.</div><br>
			<p>

			<div class="jumbotron-2">
				3. Is understanding of the structures important for citizens of our information environment, or can an individual succeed without understanding how things work?<br> 
				Share your discoveries.</div><br>
