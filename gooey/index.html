			<div class="jumbotron-1">
				1. What have you acquired from the previous module? How are things you have learned different from what you knew before the module?</div><br>
			<p>
				This module about information structures taught me that computers use specific languages to build webpages, write documents, and follow instructions. Everything we see on a webpage is text processed and structured by the computer. <br>
			Even this web page is all text!

			Extenisble markup language, or XML, is the base language used to create all other types of coding languages, like HTML and CSS. In the photo above, I used HTML to create a structure for this webpage, but I also used XML. The doctype declaration at the top of the image is XML, as well as the title of the page. It tells the computer that this file should be read and rendered as an HTML file, and it should be labeled as "Module 3."

				2. How do you interact with the structures we have discussed? Talk about instances in your academic and non-academic life.</div><br>

			<div class="jumbotron-2">
				3. Is understanding of the structures important for citizens of our information environment, or can an individual succeed without understanding how things work?<br> 
				Share your discoveries.</div><br>
