		<h3>Module 3: Information Structures</h3>
		<p>
			<div class="jumbotron-1">
				1. What have you acquired from the previous module? How are things you have learned different from what you knew before the module?</div><br>
			<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This module about information structures taught me that computers use specific languages to build webpages, write documents, and follow instructions. Everything we see on a webpage is text processed and structured by the computer. <br>
			<br>Even this web page is all text! See:

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extenisble markup language, or XML, is the framework used to create all other types of coding languages, like hyper text markup language (HTML) and cascading style sheets (CSS). In the photo above, I used HTML to create a structure for this webpage, but I also used XML. The doctype declaration at the top of the image is XML, as well as the title and links. The doctype declaration tells the computer that this file should be read and rendered as an HTML file. The title defines the webpage's name, and the links are associated with the CSS document and imported fonts. This text is not seen on the page, but the computer uses this metadata to build the page correctly.<br><br>

			Notice the doctype comment at the top.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XML, HTML, and CSS all have specific standards of use on the web. As Dr. Berquist said, it is helpful to know the web standards "so that we can know when and why we might have to deviate from them." Web standards apply to both the structural layer (HTML and XML) and the presentational layer (CSS). For example, using HTML code for presentational purposes such as background color or font color, although it might show up on the webpage, would not be an appropriate use of HTML. To change presentational features, you should use CSS.<br><br>
			
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides coding languages, I also learned about relational databases. A single-table database is known as a flat database. It's simple to create and use, but it cannot work for large scale databases because flat databases can produce a lot of redundancy of information. For example, the table below is an example of a flat database:<br>
			<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13002608/10264318/c81cf22a-69d5-11e5-9878-b6b2de7edbd2.png"><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this table is very small, it has many redundancies. Penguin publishing group is repeated 4 different times under entity "Publisher," and the Penguin email is repeated another 4 times, too. John Steinbeck is listed three times for three separate books. JK Rowling is also listed twice. The table is not sorted alphabetically, and there is no individual specific identifier, like a primary key, to distinguish between authors or titles. In all, this table could be better represented using a relational database.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relational database is created by breaking apart the flat database into multiple tables, or entities, with specific and relavent attributes. Using the example above, I would create entities like<br><br>
			* Book -- attributes could be "Title" and "ISBN"<br>
			* Publisher -- attributes could be "Name," "City," and "Email"<br>
			* Author -- attributes could be "Name," "Age," and "Hometown"<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll also need to create a primary key as a unique identifier for each book. I can use the ISBN number. These new categories will be related to each other in the database. Now, when someone wants to find out what books Penguin has published, they can create a query and search the database. In INLS 161, we did some basic database management practice, and we created a relational databse and queries from a large flat database. Here are some of the database files we worked with:<br><br>
			* <a href="http://rcmetcalf.github.io/content/inls-161-book-database.odb">Book Database</a><br>
			<br>
			Inside the above file, there are 2 tables or entities, Books and Publishers. After we created our relational database and added our PubID primary key, we were able to create relationships betweem the tables. I created queries like "Books published in the U.S. before 1950" to find very specific information.<br>

				2. How do you interact with the structures we have discussed? Talk about instances in your academic and non-academic life.</div><br>
			<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal website. Built this webpage to practice HTML and CSS coding from scratch. Takes a lot of trial and error, Google searches to get it right. 
			
			School. Sakai site. Microsoft/software -- word processing even has code associated. 
			
			Use web all the time in personal life. Phone, laptop, any electronic device. But I don't see the code, I just see the finished product -- computer does all the "behind the scenes" work. Only time I see code is when there is an error.
			
			Museum!!! Interactive exhibits, videos have to be coded...
			</p><br>
			<div class="jumbotron-2">
				3. Is understanding of the structures important for citizens of our information environment, or can an individual succeed without understanding how things work?<br> 
				Share your discoveries.</div><br>
			<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I learned about information structures, I rarely thought about the time and resources put into web and other electronic development.
