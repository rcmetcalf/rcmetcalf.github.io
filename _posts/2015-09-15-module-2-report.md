<strong><a name="section1">About this page</a></strong><br>
a. The index above is linked to subject titles. For example, "I. About this page" in the index links to the "About this page" title directly above. (try it)

<strong><a name="section2">Task 1</a></strong><br>
<a name="section2.1">a. Tasks I perform as a student:</a><br>
* Take class notes, both on my computer and on paper <br>
* Make flashcards for studying <br>
* Read assigned texts, both online and in textbooks <br>
* Write essays, module reports, and other written assignments <br>
* Study for exams and quizzes <br>
* Go to academic advising appointments <br>
<a name="section2.2">b. Information I use to perform each task:</a><br>
* Notes are copied from the professor's lecture -- written notes are kept in spiral notebooks, and typed notes are kept in separate class-specified docx files in my computer's "Documents" folder <br>
* Readings are either downloaded from the web or found in a textbook -- online readings are kept in my "Downloads" folder, and textbooks just find a home on my desk, dresser, or backpack for easy access
* Slides or other visual aids used in the lecture are downloaded as extra reference for notes -- these files are downloaded from the class website or Sakai and usually kept only in my "Downloads" folder (I rarely move them to my "Documents" folder) <br>
* Online sources and text sources are used to compile research for essays -- for online sources, I either bookmark the webpage or copy & paste the URL into a text editor document. I use sticky notes and highlighters to mark information in texts <br>
* I combine all of the above information sources to study -- if I create a special study guide, I place it on my desktop for easy access while studying <br>
* To schedule academic advising appointments, I access the UNC Advising website -- I receive emails after scheduling appointments and leave them "unread" as reminders to attend <br>
<a name="section2.3">c. How I organize these items in my workspace</a><br>
* My class notes are all contained in separate docx files, differentiated by class. For example, my notes for <em>JOMC 137</em>, Intro to Advertising and Public Relations, are all kept in a word document named "jomc-137." Each individual JOMC 137 class I attend receives its own tab with notes, and has a label indicating the date of that class. I like to use the "Notebook Template" in Microsoft Word specifically because of this tab feature! Here's an example of a typical page in my digital notebook: <br>

<center>Note the dated tabs and highlighted headings. I also use various levels of bullet points to denote content hierarchy.</center><br>
