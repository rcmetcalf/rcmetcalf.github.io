<strong><a name="section1">About this page</a></strong><br>
<a name="section1.1">a. How it works</a><br>
* The index above is linked to subject titles. For example, "I. About this page" in the index links to the "About this page" title directly above. (try it)<br>

<strong><a name="section2">Task 1</a></strong><br>
<a name="section2.1">a. Tasks I perform as a student:</a><br>
* Take class notes, both on my computer and on paper <br>
* Make flashcards for studying <br>
* Read assigned texts, both online and in textbooks <br>
* Write essays, module reports, and other written assignments <br>
* Study for exams and quizzes <br>
* Go to academic advising appointments <br><br>
<a name="section2.2">b. Information I use to perform each task:</a><br>
* Notes are copied from the professor's lecture -- written notes are kept in spiral notebooks, and typed notes are kept in separate class-specified docx files in my computer's "Documents" folder (<a href="#docs">image of "Documents" folder</a>)<br>
* Readings are either downloaded from the web or found in a textbook -- online readings are kept in my "Downloads" folder, and textbooks just find a home on my desk, dresser, or backpack for easy access <br>
* Slides or other visual aids used in the lecture are downloaded as extra reference for notes -- these files are downloaded from the class website or Sakai and usually kept only in my "Downloads" folder (I rarely move them to my "Documents" folder) <br>
* Online sources and text sources are used to compile research for essays -- for online sources, I either bookmark the webpage or copy & paste the URL into a text editor document. I use sticky notes and highlighters to mark information in texts <br>
* I combine all of the above information sources to study -- if I create a special study guide, I place it on my desktop for easy access while studying <br>
* To schedule academic advising appointments, I access the UNC Advising website -- I receive emails after scheduling appointments and leave them "unread" as reminders to attend <br><br>
<a name="section2.3">c. How I organize these items in my workspace</a><br>
* My class notes are all contained in separate docx files, differentiated by class. For example, my notes for JOMC 137, <em>Intro to Advertising and Public Relations</em>, are all kept in a word document named "jomc-137." Each individual JOMC 137 class I attend receives its own tab with notes, and has a label indicating the date of that class. I like to use the "Notebook Template" in Microsoft Word specifically because of this tab feature! Here's an example of a typical page in my digital notebook: <br>

<center>Note the dated tabs and highlighted headings. I also use various levels of bullet points to denote content hierarchy.</center><br>
* I wish I could say I was more organized, but I do not create separate folders for class content (readings or slides) that I download online. I heavily rely on the "search" function in Mac's Finder to locate content on my computer. This method works fairly well in my documents folder, where I name many of the files. It has not proven very effective in my downloads folder, because I often do not name or do not remember the name of the particular files; however, arranging files by "Date Modified" helps me sort out the relevant information.<br>
* For physical content, such as textbooks and notebooks, I store less-utilized textbooks on my bedroom shelf -- out of the way. Textbooks and notebooks that are accessed more than once a week get prime real estate on my desk and dresser. These locations are much less organized than the bookshelf, though, because textbooks are always being exchanged for different subject books. My desk itself itself is divided into well-organized and not well-organized content. For example, my physical desktop is very cluttered. I usually place books, food, drinks, and random items there for easy access, but it can be difficult to find things sometimes (I couldn't find my keys last night...). Some parts of my desktop are organized, like my pen and pencil holders and my collection of sticky note reminders. All of these utility items are placed on the bottom level of my desk. The second and third levels of my desk have only decorative items. I purposefully placed those items there so they would not be in the way or cluttered by my utility items (textbooks, pens & pencils, food, etc.). Here's how my desk currently looks:<br>

<center>A very cluttered desk means a very busy week.</center> <br>
* Online nformation collected for essays is stored on my computer in a text editor document, where each URL corresponds to an information source on the web. Text sources like textbooks are added to the mess of my desk, but they are large enough to find pretty easily; however, in my history class, I have to print a lot of single page documents for class discussion and essay writing. I store all of these paper documents in a three-hole-punch folder. It's bright blue and easy to find, even if it is piled under desk clutter.<br>

<a name="section3.1">a. How my non-academic resources are organized</a><br>
* Music -- I think my music files are more well-organized than other files on my computer. I use the music player Spotify to listen to music. On Spotify, you can make playlists, "star" songs you like, and follow other people's playlists. My playlists are Spotify are all named for the type of music they represent. For example, "workout," "tunes," and "Christmas!!" are all playlists that I compiled. The playlist "tunes" is an example of a controlled vocabulary. Although people may know that the word "tunes" means some type of music, they don't know what "tunes" means specifically in my vocabulary, so they can not guess the content of that playlist (my "tunes" playlist is all new music). Other playlists like "Best Cello Recordings" and "Epic Classical" were created by Spotify, so I did not name or compile these playlists. But they are well-labeled! I think my music is more organized than my digital documents because it makes for easy listening while studying. I don't have to constantly search through my computer to load the next song I want to hear; on Spotify, it plays automatically from the playlist. My Spotify playlist folder looks like this:<br>

* Closet -- If nothing else in my room is organized, at least my closet is. My closet is roughly color-coded (prints can be tricky) from white, to pink/red, to blue/navy, to gray, to black. At the very far right of my closet, after the black clothing, are my dresses, color-coded in a similar order. Full-length dresses, however, are placed together, regardless of color, at the very end of the closet bar. That way, long dresses aren't hanging down into my shoes and other things at the bottom of the closet. I color-code because it helps me find clothing faster. I am notoriously slow at getting ready, so keeping my closet organized is one way to help expedite the process. Take a look at my closet here:<br>

* For club meetings and other tasks, I use my email as a reminder system. I save "unread" emails in my inbox as reminders to to 1) read the email, 2) respond to the email, 3) remember the date or time of an event listed in an email, or 4) research the email topic a little more. Here's some of the unread messages in my inbox:

<center>I save emails, such as the advising reminder above, to remember meetings and events!</center><br>
After I complete a task liking replying to an email or going to the event, I mark the email as "read." It's similar to checking an item off a to-do list, just digitally. It's also easier for me to use my email as a reminder system because I can easily search my inbox for a specific email, just in case I marked one as "read" when it needed to stay "unread." <br><br>
<a name="section3.2">b. How SILS influences my digital organization</a><br>
After taking INLS 161, I started to change how I organize my information online. In class, we created a website and Github repositories, which I now use to post homework assignments and practice coding. Building a website has probably been the most helpful in improving my digital organization. If a file is not in the right folder or not linked to correctly, then my website won't load content correctly. I had to learn that folders were my friend!! Placing every single file on its own (as I do in my computer's "Documents" folder) does not work well in my website repository. I separate related content into different folders. For example, "_posts" folder contains all the information in my website posts, while "content" contains markdown files of class notes and other documents that I can link to on the website. Here's my repository for my wesite, <a href="http://rcmetcalf.github.io">rcmetcalf.github.io</a>:<br>

If I keep all my information organized correctly, then my webpage renders correctly...<br>

If I don't keep it organized, then I get this...and a big headache<br>
<image src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13002608/9935417/7aa411d0-5d24-11e5-9ab2-54f41a68f60e.png" />
I'm trying to organize all of the digital content on my computer in the same way that I organize my repositories. That way, I won't have any problems finding information in case a Finder search fails.<br>
I think it would diffiuclt for someone else to use my organization structure, especially in my "Documents" and "Downloads" folder, because there isn't much of a structure in place. Unless someone knew the name of the document they wanted or the date it was created/modified, they would have a difficult time locating it. I don't a problem using it, though, because I know how I name files. I name notes "subject-class number," like "jomc-137" or "inls-201," but I name written assignments without as much structure. Some are single words, like "leads," and others are slightly more descriptive, like "nc-lottery-article" (view <a href="#docs">Images</a> for an example). Either way, a person using my information structure would have to understand my controlled vocabulary and classification system to use my organization structure.

<a name="section3.3">c. Percentage of school-related content in digital and physical deskspace</a><br>
I would say only 10-15% of my physical space is occupied by school-related content, most of that being textbooks. I only use a paper notebook in one class because laptops are not allowed.
