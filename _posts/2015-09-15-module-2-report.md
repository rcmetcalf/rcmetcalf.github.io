<strong><a name="section1">About this page</a></strong><br>
a. The index above is linked to subject titles. For example, "I. About this page" in the index links to the "About this page" title directly above. (try it)

<strong><a name="section2">Task 1</a></strong><br>
<a name="section2.1">a. Tasks I perform as a student:</a><br>
* Take class notes, both on my computer and on paper <br>
* Make flashcards for studying <br>
* Read assigned texts, both online and in textbooks <br>
* Write essays, module reports, and other written assignments <br>
* Study for exams and quizzes <br>
* Go to academic advising appointments <br><br>
<a name="section2.2">b. Information I use to perform each task:</a><br>
* Notes are copied from the professor's lecture -- written notes are kept in spiral notebooks, and typed notes are kept in separate class-specified docx files in my computer's "Documents" folder <br>
* Readings are either downloaded from the web or found in a textbook -- online readings are kept in my "Downloads" folder, and textbooks just find a home on my desk, dresser, or backpack for easy access
* Slides or other visual aids used in the lecture are downloaded as extra reference for notes -- these files are downloaded from the class website or Sakai and usually kept only in my "Downloads" folder (I rarely move them to my "Documents" folder) <br>
* Online sources and text sources are used to compile research for essays -- for online sources, I either bookmark the webpage or copy & paste the URL into a text editor document. I use sticky notes and highlighters to mark information in texts <br>
* I combine all of the above information sources to study -- if I create a special study guide, I place it on my desktop for easy access while studying <br>
* To schedule academic advising appointments, I access the UNC Advising website -- I receive emails after scheduling appointments and leave them "unread" as reminders to attend <br><br>
<a name="section2.3">c. How I organize these items in my workspace</a><br>
* My class notes are all contained in separate docx files, differentiated by class. For example, my notes for <em>JOMC 137</em>, Intro to Advertising and Public Relations, are all kept in a word document named "jomc-137." Each individual JOMC 137 class I attend receives its own tab with notes, and has a label indicating the date of that class. I like to use the "Notebook Template" in Microsoft Word specifically because of this tab feature! Here's an example of a typical page in my digital notebook: <br>

<center>Note the dated tabs and highlighted headings. I also use various levels of bullet points to denote content hierarchy.</center><br>
* I wish I could say I was more organized, but I do not create separate folders for class content (readings or slides) that I download online. I heavily rely on the "search" function in Mac's Finder to locate content on my computer. This method works fairly well in my documents folder, where I name many of the files. It has not proven very effective in my downloads folder, because I often do not name or do not remember the name of the particular files; however, arranging files by "Date Modified" helps me sort out the relevant information.<br>
* For physical content, such as textbooks and notebooks, I store less-utilized textbooks on my bedroom shelf -- out of the way. Textbooks and notebooks that are accessed more than once a week get prime real estate on my desk and dresser. These locations are much less organized than the bookshelf, though, because textbooks are always being exchanged for different subject books. My desk itself itself is divided into well-organized and not well-organized content. For example, my physical desktop is very cluttered. I usually place books, food, drinks, and random items there for easy access, but it can be difficult to find things sometimes (I couldn't find my keys last night...). Some parts of my desktop are organized, like my pen and pencil holders and my collection of sticky note reminders. All of these utility items are placed on the bottom level of my desk. The second and third levels of my desk have only decorative items. I purposefully placed those items there so they would not be in the way or cluttered by my utility items (textbooks, pens & pencils, food, etc.). Here's how my desk currently looks:<br>

<center>A very cluttered desk means a very busy week.</center> <br>
* Online nformation collected for essays is stored on my computer in a text editor document, where each URL corresponds to an information source on the web. Text sources like textbooks are added to the mess of my desk, but they are large enough to find pretty easily; however, in my history class, I have to print a lot of single page documents for class discussion and essay writing. I store all of these paper documents in a three-hole-punch folder. It's bright blue and easy to find, even if it is piled under desk clutter.<br><br>
