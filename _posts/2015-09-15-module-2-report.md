a. The index above is linked to subject titles. For example, "I. Introduction" in the index links to the "Introduction" title directly above. (try it)


<a name="section2">Task 1</a><br>
a. As a student, most of my tasks center around notetaking and reading. I prefer to take my notes on my computer because I can search my notes using keywords, type more words than writing, and I don't have to worry about having the correct binder. I always have the right "notebook" when I have my Mac!
