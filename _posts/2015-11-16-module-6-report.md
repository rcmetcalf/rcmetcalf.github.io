<b>What have you acquired from the previous module? How are things you have learned different from what you knew before the module?</b><br>
This was one of my favorite module. I am very interested in the human-computer interaction, and how information design can positively or negatively affect how people use a website, book, building, etc.<br>

I learned about information design ???? In a class about information science nad technology, it's eassy for me to forget that the brain is one of the most important information processors around. Learning about "chunks," or units of information, represented how uniwuely the human brain works. I attribute "chunking" with my ability to memorize word spellings (I learned to spell "restaurant" as a kid by grouping chunks res-tau-rant) and long strings of numbers (for example, my social security number). <br>

In Module 6, one familiar theme for me was "know your audience." As a student in a public relations & advertising class and journalism class, the number one question to ask before you begin crafting a campaign or writing a news stories is, "Who is my audience?" The same question applies to information design. To build effective interfaces, webpages, and other materials, designers must know the audience. In class, we discussed the different interface designs in airplanes. In commercial airplanes, <br>

While I was taking INLS 161 this past summer, I was introduced to the world of information design; I used information design on my webpage: I changed background and font colors, bolded headings, and added extra navigation features to the top left drop-down menu. I made all of these changes to improve readability, clarity, and ease of information finding. Before this module, though, I thought that information design only applied to web design; in INLS 201, however, we learned the information design can apply to buildings and any technological interface as well.<br>

<b>How has good and how has bad information design affected you? Talk about instances in your academic and non-academic life.</b><br>
bad design in personal life = wwww.phimu.org 
bad design in academic = powerpoints w/ tons of words


<b>Is good design essential, or just a nice to have component? Share your discoveries.</b><br>
Good design is essential.
