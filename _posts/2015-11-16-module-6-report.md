<b>What have you acquired from the previous module? How are things you have learned different from what you knew before the module?</b><br>
This was one of my favorite modules. I am very interested in the human-computer interaction, and how information design can positively or negatively affect how people use a website, book, or building.<br>

I think I have a greater understanding of the topics of information design and information architecture after completing this module. In information design, interface and web designers need to "think about how people think." Building well-designed information includes understanding how users interact with interfaces (known as user experience or UX), how they seek and search for information, how different personalities and demographics interact with information. I think of information architecture as the outline or blueprint for information design. It can be a navigational aid, a map (like a webpage's site map), or the collection of ontology, taxonomy, and choreography.<br>

* <b>Ontology</b> is the way we understand concepts in a type of domain. The semantic web is an example of an ontology.<br>
* <b>Taxonomy</b> is the layout of an organization. A site map is an exmaple of a taxonomy.<br>
* <b>Choreography</b> is the rules for interaction between the parts of ontology and taxonomy. It includes exact and ambigious classification. Alphabetical order is an example of exact classfication, and the Dewey Decimal System is an example of ambigious classification.<br>

In a class about information science and technology, it's easy for me that phones and computers are not the most important information processors around. The human brain is a complex and powerful processor. Learning about "chunks," or units of information, represented how uniquely the human brain works. I attribute "chunking" with my ability to memorize word spellings (I learned to spell "restaurant" as a kid by grouping chunks res-tau-rant) and long strings of numbers (for example, my social security number). We revisited <b>Mooer's Law</b> in our class discussion of human-computer interaction, or HCI.<br>

* Mooer's Law states that if a design is too hard or painful to use, people will not use it.<br>

In Module 6, one familiar theme for me was "know your audience." As a student in a public relations & advertising class and journalism class, the number one question to ask before you begin crafting a campaign or writing a news stories is, "Who is my audience?" The same question applies to information design. To build effective interfaces, webpages, and other materials, designers must know the audience. In class, we discussed the different interface designs in airplanes. For example, in commercial airplanes, the cockpit interface is purposefully designed to be symmetrical so that when pilots switch seats, all of the controls and buttons are still in the same place as before. Designers of the interface needed to know their audience (pilots) to understand how to best design the cockpit interface.<br>

In INLS 161 this past summer, I was introduced to the world of information design through my webpage; I changed background and font colors, bolded headings, and added extra navigation features to the top left drop-down menu. I made all of these changes to improve readability, clarity, and ease of information seeking. Before this module, though, I thought that information design only applied to web design. In INLS 201, however, we learned the information design can apply to buildings and any technological interface as well. Manning Hall, for example, is a type of user interface system. People interact with Manning's different floors, classrooms, and bathrooms when navigating the building. Despite signage, Manning Hall is a poorly designed user interface system. Only experienced Manning Hall users (professors or faculty) will know how to navigate the system with success.<br>

<b>How has good and how has bad information design affected you? Talk about instances in your academic and non-academic life.</b><br>
Good and bad design has influenced me on a daily basis. In my non-academic life, I access good information design in popular social media applications. My favorite apps, Instagram and Snapchat, are both simple to use but have a lot of features. Snapchat is so easy to use that my 2 1/2 year old niece can use it:<br>

Because these social media apps are well-designed, I end up using them very often. Mooer's Law does not affect these interfaces!<br>

Bad design is also apparent in my personal life. As a committee chair in my sorority, I am responsible for filling out forms and ordering items through our national sorority's website. The <a href="http://phimu.org/Home">Phi Mu national website</a> has to be one of the worst designed websites I have used (Connect Carolina is also up there). Even though I have used the website multiple times throughout the semester, I always struggle to find the correct forms and navigate the website. The website is bright and colorful, but it could be improved with a better layout and an actual site map -- I can never find one.<br>

Good design in my academic life is very important because it increases my organization and retention of class discussions. I use the "Notebook" template in Microsoft word to take all of my class notes:<br>

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13002608/11220211/c943f1c4-8d2c-11e5-82bc-e6d29ac30b52.png"><br>

I like this interface because it is easy for me to search the document for keywords, created dated tabs for each class, and record audio notes alongside my written notes. If I wrote notes in a plain word document, I would have to either create a new document for each class, or continuously add to a very long document. Taking notes on my laptop also allows me to take notes faster, include links, and insert pictures or tables if needed.<br>

Finally, poor design in my academic life usually appears in the form of Powerpoints. I have professors who upload a slide filled top to bottom with information. Students rush to copy down because professors say, "It will all be on the exam," but students are too busy copying notes word for word to actually absorb information from the lecture. I prefer when slides have pictures or very little text, because it forces me to pay attention to the speaker's lecture, not just the visual presentation. In INLS 161, we discussed <a href="http://inls161.johndmart.in/schedule/death-by-powerpoint/">problems with Powerpoint</a> and other presentation tools. Problems arise when the user does not use the tools as an aid and, instead, use these tools as crutches.<br>

<b>Is good design essential, or just a nice to have component? Share your discoveries.</b><br>
Good design is essential. If information is designed and organized well, it can influence how effectively people process the information presented. Good design improves user attention, participation, and reception. In INLS 161, we spent a lot of time talking about poor information design, and how it was a direct result of user error. Presentation tools like Powerpoint and Prezi are not inherently poorly designed, but users can create poorly designed and organized information with them. My favorite example of the impact a poorly designed presentation can have is the <a href="http://www.norvig.com/Gettysburg/index.htm">Gettysburg Powerpoint Presentation</a>. It takes the Gettysburg Address, one of the most important and well-known speeches in American history and translates it into a typical Powerpoint presentation of today. The presentation shows how good information can be misrepresented or lose effect if the information design is bad.
