# <center>Hometown History</center>

I'm still a little wishy-washy on my topic, but I think I would like to make a presentation about my hometown of New Bern, North Carolina, and specifically, the colonial mansion Tryon Palace. New Bern served as North Carolina's first state capital (before relocated to Raleigh), and Tryon Palace as the first Governor's mansion. I worked as a marketing & communications intern for Tryon Palace last summer, so I take a special interest in the history and culture associated with the site.

I plan to use a combination of text, images, and videos. May also include one GIF.
