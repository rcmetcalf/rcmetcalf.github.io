# Proud Tar Heel at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Despite a diverse range of interests, including history, writing, design, and event planning, I was able to structure a degree program that fully engaged my interests.

I am working towards a B.A. in Media and Journalism, with a concentration in Public Relations, and a B.A. in Archaeology. In addition to these degree programs, I am minoring in Information and Library Science.

Courses:

* ANTH 451 Archaeology Field School
* ANTH 250 North American Archaeology
* ANTH 222 Prehistoric Art
* more


Cumulative GPA: 3.703
