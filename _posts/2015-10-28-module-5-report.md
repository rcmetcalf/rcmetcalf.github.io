<strong>What have you acquired from the previous module? How are things you have learned different from what you knew before the module?</strong><br>
When I previously thought about information retrieval, I primarily thought of Google searches. So when we started this module, I thought this video about Google<br>
<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mTBShTwCnD4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>video</iframe></center><br>
best described my view of information retrieval. I've been using Google for as long as I can remember, but I have never known the information science behind the search engine. In this module, we learned a few things about Google's search process.<br>

First, I learned that Google uses the <strong>Boolean model</strong> in all of its web searches. The Boolean model is used to return "exact matches" from a query. For example, when I do a Google search for "blue socks," I receive results for exactly that -- blue socks. Not just the color blue, or not just socks. Google returns websites that match the query "blue AND socks."<br><br>
* <em>P.S. We've talked about another Boolean idea before! In <a href="http://rcmetcalf.github.io/2015/09/03/module-1-report/">Module 1</a>, we learned that Boolean algebra, or the true/false and 0/1 value, was used by Claude Shannon in his development of information theory and binary digits (bits).</em>
<br>

Second, I learned that Google uses "page rank" to provide users with the most relevant and important pages in a search. Page rank determines which pages are most relevant by counting the number of times the keyword is repeated in a document, if the keyword is represented in an important part of the page, like the title, and the number of in-links into the webpage. For example, when I searched "blue socks" the top three results either had "blue socks" in the page title or had a large number of in-links: "Blue Q Socks" (a sock brand), "Men's Blue Socks at Nordstrom" (a large department store), and "Blue Socks on Amazon" (a site packed with in-links from all over the web).<br>

Third, I learned that Google uses web crawlers to index the web. These "bugs" are constantly moving from one site to another, gathering data about page titles, text, and in- and out-links. Before this module, I never thought about <em>how</em> Google knew the latest or most relevant information. I just figured there was a huge office of people manually cataloging the web. As discussed in the video <a href="https://youtu.be/VWQ34lEsd0c">"The History of Search Engines"</a>, Yahoo was actually doing just that in 1994, but within one year, the number of websites drastically increased and Yahoo could not manually catalog the web any longer. Web crawlers, paired with Google's page rank algorithm, helped Google return more relevant results than other search engines even though the web was increasing exponentially.<br>

Lastly, I learned that Google does not know everything. It is hard to believe that there are still things that can't be found on the global web, but I believe it's important to understand that "offline" information retrieval can be just as effective as online searches. For example, Dr. Bergquist challenged us to find out if an author named Otto Müller was still living, and if not, to find out when he died. Although it seemed easy, it was difficult to find the right Otto Müller. Here are some of the Otto's I found that were not the correct Otto Müller:

* Otto Müller the German painter. He died in 1930.<br>
* Otto Müller the German novelist. He died in 1894.<br>
* Otto-Werner Mueller the German conductor. He is still living.<br>

Google did its job correctly. It returned results with the keywords "Otto Muller" or "Otto Mueller." But it could not find the Otto I was looking for. As it turned out, I should have directed my queries about Müller to Dr. Bergquist, not Google; Dr. Bergquist lived in Gerhardsbrunn for a while, had known who Otto Müller was, and even owned a copy of a book that contained information about Müller, including his date of death.

While writing this report, I tried to search for Müller one last time, and I hit the jackpot. My query was "otto muller author gerhardsbrunn." The fourth Google result was a <a href="https://prezi.com/7lqg53fybtch/module-5-report/">Prezi made by an INLS 201 student</a> for Module 5. In it, she explains that the book containing information about Müller was in our Manning classroom all along and belonged to Dr. Bergquist. When we asked Google for the nearest copy of that book, it returned results for libraries and other public institutions, but it could not return information about <em>privately</em> owned books because that information was not indexed on the web.

By the end of this module, I think my understanding of information retrieval shifted from the Google-centric model to a more broad concept. While Google is a valuable tool, it has its limitations. Knowing that other forms of information retrieval exist, and that people themselves can be machines of information retrieval, is necessary for filling in gaps current technologies leaves.

<strong>How do you search, and evaluate information? Talk about instances in your academic and non-academic life.</strong><br>
On any given day, I probably do 10-15 Google searches.<br>
In academics, I constantly use information retrieval for homework, essays, course planning and more. When I write an essay, I use a basic Google search to get a broad understanding of the subject. I trust information that comes from credible websites, and I discard information that is either very low in relevance or ranked toward the very end of the search. Once I know more about what I'm researching, I begin to look in scholarly journal databases and use relevant keywords in searches. If there are books about the subject, I search UNC Library's online catalog, too. Again, I look for relevance; if an article or book only lists a keyword once, it probably won't be very useful.<br>

Besides online shopping, I primarily use non-academic information retrieval in genealogy research. Last summer, I began to research my family's genealogy. I was specifically interested in my mom's family. My maternal grandmother was born and raised in England, so it was a special challenge to find my foreign family history. To find information, I used Google, database and national archive searches. I began my search with a few things I already knew to be true:<br>

* My grandfather, Francis Gavin Boyle, served in WWII in England<br>
* Francis was originally from Massachusetts<br>
* He met and married my grandmother, Molly Irene Sharman, in England during WWII<br>
* Molly was from Higham Ferrers, Northamptonshire, England<br>
* Molly's mother was Kate Sharman (we have an old family photo of her in Northamptonshire)<br>

I started my genealogical search at the<a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/">UK National Archives</a>. After some digging, I found out that Kate Sharman had been married to Ralph Sharman of Higham Ferrers.

My biggest breakthrough in research happened when I did a simple search: "Ralph Sharman Higham Ferrers." I found a website created by a family that had extensively researched their genealogy. Lucky for me, <a href="http://jones3995.tripod.com/blackwellsullivan/blackwell.html">this website</a> contained information about Kate Sharman, my great-grandmother, and her husband Ralph's family, the Sharmans and Blackwells.

I found out that Kate's maiden name was Cobley, and in 1955 she boarded the passenger ship Queen Elizabeth for New York. My guess is that she was on her way to visit her only daughter, and my grandmother, Molly Sharman (now Mrs. Molly Boyle) in the United States. After the discovery of this website, I also learned that Ralph served and was injured in WWI. I was later able to find a certificate that showed he had received a medal of honor for his service.<br>

There were many times while I was researching that I found information that seemed like it was relevant to me because it matched my keywords; however, after some fact-checking with my mother (my go-to information retrieval machine), I realized this information did not match with my genealogy. For example, I found this result for Francis G Boyle in military service records:<br>

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13002608/10810819/05f5390e-7ddb-11e5-8521-9cd02589c9e2.png"><br>

Although this appeared to be my grandfather because of similarity in name, state, military enlistment, and marital status, my mother told me that Grandpa Francis did not serve in Hawaii, and he was a Tech Sergeant, not a Master Sergeant. Like Otto Müller, there are many Francis Boyles that fit the search in name, but not in reality. I think this illustrates again how important it is to understand the current limitations of information retrieval online.<br>

<strong>How do you think information retrieval is related to human life? Share your discoveries.</strong><br>
I think information retrieval is an entirely human process. Humans have created and continued to utilize technology specifically for the improvement of information retrieval. We no longer use search engines like <a href="https://youtu.be/Sr3bWDBWnPE">Altavista</a> because it could not provide enough relevant, important information for users like newer search engines Yahoo and Google could. People depend on information retrieval for fast, accurate and relevant information that they can use in their everyday lives.

But the use of information retrieval did not begin with search engines; libraries and archives have been in the information retrieval business much longer. Many of these institutions, like the <a href="http://archives.ncdcr.gov/">State Archives of North Carolina</a>, are now digitalizing their collections so that people can access the information easier. I use online archive services like this very often in my genealogical searches!<br>

Dr. Jamie Arguello even suggested that everyday apps like Facebook, Pandora, Twitter and Youtube are types of information retrieval systems. When I want to find a video, I usually go straight to Youtube. When I need to find a friend or classmate, I try to search for them on Facebook. These information retrieval systems are very closely associated with human-to-human interaction, and they have helped make the world more socially connected.
