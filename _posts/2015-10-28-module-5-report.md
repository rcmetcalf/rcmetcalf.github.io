1. What have you acquired from the previous module? How are things you have learned different from what you knew before the module?<br>
When I previously thought about information retrieval, I primarily thought of Google searches. So when we started this module, I thought <a href="https://youtu.be/mTBShTwCnD4">this video about Google</a> best described my view of information retrieval. I've been using Google for as long as I can remember, but I have never known the information science behind the search engine. In this module, we learned a few things about Google.<br>
First, I learned that Google uses the <strong>Boolean model</strong> in all of its web searches. The Boolean model is used to return "exact matches" from a query. For example, when I do a Google search for "blue socks," I receive results for exactly that -- blue socks. Not just the color blue, or not just socks. Google returned websites that matched the query "blue AND socks."<br>
Second, I learned that Google uses "page rank"

2. How do you search, and evaluate information? Talk about instances in your academic and non-academic life.<br>



3. How do you think information retrieval is related to human life? Share your discoveries.<br>



I began my search with a few things I already knew to be true:<br>
* My grandfather, Francis Gavin Boyle, served in WWII in England<br>
* Francis was originally from Massachusetts<br>
* He met and married my grandmother, Molly Irene Sharman, in England during WWII<br>
* Molly was from Northamptonshire county in England<br>
* Molly's mother was Kate Sharman (we have an old family photo of her in Northamptonshire)<br>

I started my geneaological search at <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/">the UK National Archives</a>. 

My biggest breakthrough in research happened this summer when I found a website created by a genealogical researcher.
