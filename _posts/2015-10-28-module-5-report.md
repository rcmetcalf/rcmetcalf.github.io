<strong>What have you acquired from the previous module? How are things you have learned different from what you knew before the module?</strong><br>
When I previously thought about information retrieval, I primarily thought of Google searches. So when we started this module, I thought <a href="https://youtu.be/mTBShTwCnD4">this video about Google</a> best described my view of information retrieval. I've been using Google for as long as I can remember, but I have never known the information science behind the search engine. In this module, we learned a few things about Google's search process.<br><br>

First, I learned that Google uses the <strong>Boolean model</strong> in all of its web searches. The Boolean model is used to return "exact matches" from a query. For example, when I do a Google search for "blue socks," I receive results for exactly that -- blue socks. Not just the color blue, or not just socks. Google returns websites that match the query "blue AND socks."<br>

* <em>P.S. We've talked about another Boolean idea before! In <a href="http://rcmetcalf.github.io/2015/09/03/module-1-report/">Module 1</a>, we learned that Boolean algebra, or the true/false and 0/1 value, was used by Claude Shannon in his development of information theory and binary digits (bits).</em>
<br><br>

Second, I learned that Google uses "page rank" to provide users with the most relevant and important pages. Page rank determined which pages were most relevant by counting the number of times the keyword was repeated in the document, if the keyword was represented in an important part of the page, like the title, and the number of in-links into the webpage. For example, when I searched "blue socks" the top three results either had "blue socks" in the page title or had a large number of in-links: "Blue Q Socks" (a sock brand), "Men's Blue Socks at Nordstrom" (a large department store), and "Blue Socks on Amazon" (a site packed with in-links from all over the web). 

Third, I learned that Google uses web crawlers to index the web. These "bugs" are constantly moving from one site to another, gathering data about page titles, text, and in- and out-links. Before this module, I never thought about <em>how</em> Google knew the latest or most relevant information. I just figured there was a huge office of people manually cataloguing the web. As discussed in the video <a href="https://youtu.be/VWQ34lEsd0c">"The History of Search Engines"</a>, Yahoo! was actually doing just that in 1994, but within one year, the number of websites drastically increased and Yahoo! could not manually catalogue the web any longer. Web crawlers, paired with Google's page rank algorithm, helped Google return more relevant results than other search engines even though the web was increasing exponentially. 

Lastly, I learned that Google does not know everything. It is hard to believe that there are still things that can't be found on the global web, but I believe it's important to understand that "offline" information retrieval can be just as effective as online searches. For example, Dr. Bergquist challenged us to find out if an author named Otto Müller was still living, and if not, to find out when he died. Although it seemed easy, it was difficult to find the right Otto Müller. Here are some of the Otto's I found that were not the correct Otto Müller:<br>
* Otto Müller the German painter. He died in 1930.<br>
* Otto Müller the German novelist. He died in 1894.<br>
* Otto-Werner Mueller the German conductor. He is still living.<br>
Google did its job correctly. It returned results with the keywords "Otto Muller" or "Otto Mueller." But it could not find the Otto I was looking for. As it turned out, I should have directed my queries about Müller to Dr. Bergquist, not Google; Dr. Bergquist lived in Gerhardsbrunn for a while, had known who Otto Müller was, and even owned a copy of a book that included information about Müller, including his date of death.

While writing this report, I tried to search for Müller one last time, and I think I hit the jackpot. My query was "otto muller author gerhardsbrunn." The fourth result was a Prezi made by an INLS 201 student for Module 5. In it, she explains that the book containing information about Müller was in our Manning classroom all along and belonged to Dr. Bergquist. When we asked Google for the nearest copy of that book, it returned results for libraries and other public institutions, but it could not return information about <em>privately</em> owned books because that information is not indexed on the web.



<strong>How do you search, and evaluate information? Talk about instances in your academic and non-academic life.</strong><br>
On any given day, I probably do 10-15 Google searches. 


<strong>How do you think information retrieval is related to human life? Share your discoveries.</strong><br>
I think information retrieval is an entirely human process. We have created and continue to utilize technology specifically for the improvement of information retrieval. The interest in information retrieval did not begin with Google. Ancient institutions like the Library of Alexandria catalogued and 


I began my search with a few things I already knew to be true:<br>
* My grandfather, Francis Gavin Boyle, served in WWII in England<br>
* Francis was originally from Massachusetts<br>
* He met and married my grandmother, Molly Irene Sharman, in England during WWII<br>
* Molly was from Northamptonshire county in England<br>
* Molly's mother was Kate Sharman (we have an old family photo of her in Northamptonshire)<br>

I started my geneaological search at <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/">the UK National Archives</a>. 

My biggest breakthrough in research happened this summer when I found a website created by a genealogical researcher.
