# INLS 201

## <center>What is information?</center>
If there is one thing I have learned about information from this past module, it is that information can be represented in many different ways and in many different subjects. Information can be difficult to define because of these qualities, but through the readings and class discussion, I like to think of information as a form of communication that uses various symbols, including numbers, words, shapes, and even colors, to express some meaningful message.
	
I took INLS 161, Tools for Information Literacy, this summer. During that class, I began to think information was all about computers, coding, and networks. Coding, especially, helped me understand how structured and organized information could be. The code for a heading, &lth1&gt, meant nothing to me before the class, but now I can see that specific combination of number, letter, and symbols and know that it means “heading 1.” Even more complex codes, such as codes from the CSS style sheet, are more easily understood now that I know how codes are supposed to be written and processed.
