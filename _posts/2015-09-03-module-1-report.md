## <center>What is information?</center>
If there is one thing I have learned about information from this past module, it is that information can be represented in many different ways and in many different subjects. Information can be difficult to define because of these qualities, but through the readings and class discussion, I like to think of information as a form of communication that uses various symbols, including numbers, words, shapes, and even colors, to express some meaningful message.
	
I have also learned a lot about information science, and how it existed long before modern-day computers. Information science is an interdiscplinary field. It can be studied using mathematics, philosophy, computer science, communications, and plenty more.  In class, we learned that information science is the study of the cognitive, social, technological, and organizational roles of information, but it is not entirely the same as information technology. 

Although one key orientation of information science is the specific technologies that manage information, there is also a focus on the human and social need for information. Information science has a very strong social connection because people are responsible for information sharing and retrieval. Think of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or any social media app, and see that people, or users, are the ones creating and sharing messages for other people to consume.

I took INLS 161, Tools for Information Literacy, this summer. During that class, I began to think information was all about computers, coding, and networks. Coding, especially, helped me understand how structured and organized information could be. The code for a heading <xmp><h1></xmp> meant nothing to me before the class, but now I can see that specific combination of number, letter, and symbols and know that it means “heading 1.” Even more complex codes, such as codes from the CSS style sheet, are more easily understood now that I know how the codes are supposed to be written and processed; however, INLS 201 has started to show me that information isn't all about codes and computers. Information can be used in situations of war, for road signs, and even in teaching people how to do handstands.

The concept of information still confuses me. I'll be honest. I have trouble grasping abstract concepts, and I think information can be very abstract, or at least what we have been talking about so far. I have said previously that information can be many different things, and I think that is part of my issue with understanding. But even though I might not understand every aspect of information, I do know that the concept of information affects me. I think of information as a meaningful message, used often in decision making, and composed of words, letters, symbols -- anything. When I think of information this way, I feel much less confused, and I am able to organize my notes and papers much better. I use the concept of information to find meaning in my work and my decisions.

I believe Claude Shannon is the most important information pioneer we discussed. I think I liked his work so much because I was actually able to understand it; he made the abstract physical with his development of "Theseus," the maze-solving mouse. Without his work in digital circuits and information theory, current information studies and technology would not be where it is today. Shannon developed the information theory of digital information and storage. Shannon reasoned that information could be quantified using binary digits, or "bits." These bits could write the information out in a specified series of 1 or 0, representing "true" or "false," or as simple as flipping a switch "on" or "off." 

The theory of the on/off switch had been used before with physical telegraph transmitters, but Shannon wanted to develop the on/off switch for digital transmittions, like for telephones. Although he might not have physically created computer circuits, CDs, or other storage devices, his information theory showed other researchers and scientists that digital information transmission was possible. 

Information fits in my life in many ways. I frequently use search engines like Google to do class research, map road trips, and find places to eat. Every time I use google, I am using information seeking and retrieval. Information seeking is (blank), while information retrieval is (blank). Mooer's Law for information retrieval has also affected me in collegiate life. Whenever I need to do academic research, I try to use the easiest tool to navigate archives, journal collections, and search engines. Many times, a teacher has assigned me a complicated, but "helpful," online archive or search engine that requires more effort than the output is worth. 

Even road signs and the information they convey have been an important part of my daily life. This summer, I made a 9 hour road trip to Alabama by myself. Although I was using GPS to navigate, I still needed to pay close attention to interstate signs with information about the nearest gas stations -- driving long stretches of road without knowing where the next gas station is can be a little risky. I was able to recognize signs with gas station logos, even thought I was traveling at 70 miles per hour. 

I think everyone has a different understanding of information. When I asked my friends what they thought "information" was, most talked about social media, Google, and the "bombardment" of information in today's culture, but no one had a concrete definition. I think that says a lot about what information actually is. To understand information, I think people need to accept that information comes in all shapes and forms, and it can be studied in an interdiscplinary context. 

I think information can be understood very differently depending on the subject and the studier. For example, a math major may think of information as numbers or formulas, while a journalism major may think of information as words and images. I think it is important for everyone to understand that information is a very social subject, and so, it is created and shared a certain way depending on who is interpretting the information. Just because our idea of information differs from someone else's does not mean it is wrong. It's just a different way of looking at it!
