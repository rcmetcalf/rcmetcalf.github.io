Module 1: Intro to the Information World

* information seeking = psychological state of wanting to find something
* information retrieval = process of actually finding something & bringing it back to use it 

## Claude Shannon
* Entropy is maximum when all outcomes are equally likely (if E drops, can ask fewer questions)
* bit - measure of surprise

# What is Information Science?
* predates computer science and is actually a broad, interdisciplinary field
* incorporates comp sic & other diverse fields
* information science is the study of the cognitive, social, technological, and organizational roles of info 
* 3 components:
	- content (the substance)
	- people (the interactors)
	- technology (the support)

## 2 Key orientations of Info Sci:
* to the human and social need for information
* to specific technologies that manage information

## 3 big questions:
1. the physical question: what are the features and laws of the physical universe? 
2. the social question: how do people relate to, and use information?
3. the design question: how can access to recorded information be made most rapid and effective?

## Mooers’ Law
* any info retrieval system will tend not to be used whenever it is more painful and troublesome for a customer to have info than for him not to have it

## Info Sci topics:
* representation and organization (knowledge map)
* info retrieval 
* networks and connections (social media)
* users, information needs, tasks (interface design)
* information behavior (how do people find things)
* user interfaces (changing interface rules for design)
* social informatics (how social media works)
* ethics & privacy (ex: NSA)
* policy 
*etc. (extras on slides)

## asis&t
* the association for information and technology

## ACM
* the association for computing machinery (for info and computer science)
* Grace Hopper — math professor, served in the Navy, developed the first computers, one of the founders of ACM
* “nanoseconds”

## Other important people & ideas
* “Anomalous State of Knowledge” — move through logical paths to get info (Belkin)
* “Information search process model” — move through certain steps to reach info (Kuhlthau)

## Summary
* info sci connected to info technology, but not the same
* has strong social connection
* peoples, needs, and systems all working together
